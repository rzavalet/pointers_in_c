Code samples from the book "Understanding Pointers in C"

"Understanding Pointers in C" is a book by Yashavant Kanetkar that explains the topic in an extensive way with hundreds of examples. 

In this repositories I will post some of the programs that were troublesome to understand for me. They are usually simple and short but sometimes also tricky. For example, it seems that the author used a 16 bits computer, so sometimes the explanations in the book seem odd if you don't keep this detail in mind.

For some of the problems, I have found that understanding what a variable "really is" makes things simpler. The spiral rule is useful in this case: http://c-faq.com/decl/spiral.anderson.html
